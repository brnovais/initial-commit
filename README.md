# Initial Commit

Template that I use to create the initial commit of my projects.

### Files

Initial files added to my first commit.

1. **_.gitattributes_**: normalize all text files. Be careful when using with binary files.
1. **_.gitignore_**: default files ignored in my development environment.
1. **_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md_**: sample acknowledgments of third-party software used by the project.
1. **_CHANGELOG.md_**: simple changelog for this project that can be used as a sample.
1. **_CONTRIBUTING.md_**: general guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
1. **_LICENSE.md_**: license information initially restricting access to everything in the project.
1. **_README.md_**: project introduction similar to a Getting Started.

### Commits

All commit messages are based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
